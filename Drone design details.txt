The warriors are your claws, protecting the hive from any threat that may surface. They are more than willing to lay down their lives, charging headfirst into any situation they may face, no matter how suicidal. They can detect basic radiation levels, which can be used to determine radiation hazards, or the presence of intelligent life, as many of the life forms you have met have shown to use radio to a great extent, although they lack the attunement to intercept or decipher such transmissions.

Thinker
The Thinker is a specialty drone that has been a mainstay of hives for millennia. They are capable of astounding mental calculations, data storage, and logistical management and are one of the few drones capable of operating outside of the Queen’s control for a limited time. If separated from the hive, a Thinker will use whatever resources it has available to return to the queen as soon as possible. If tasked with a mission, it will focus on completing its objective before attempting to return.

Variant: Quantum Thinker
Quantum Brain 4
Cost: 10N
Upkeep: 5
This thinker is by far one of the most unique resources of your hive. With the addition of a secondary brain that makes use of quantum computing this drone is not just capable of the incredible calculations of its mundane brethren, but also a more randomized worldview. While your thinkers are each an identical organic computer, each quantum thinker is a separate entity that processes data in different ways, assembling input in ways that would seem absurd or illogical at first, guided more by intuition, guesswork, and curiosity. While still bound by your guiding will these drones are as close to individuals as their biology allows. They will often make their own tasks and goals when left to their own devices, although more often than not such idle work tends to descend into endless debate amongst each other, as each one processes the world in a slightly different way. If you have five quantum thinkers, there will be at least five proposed solutions to any one problem.

A literal fly on the wall, this drone can infiltrate and observe in virtually any situation. It is almost impossible to detect or catch, and is more than capable of observing the enemy from under their noses unseen. More than a simple observer, however, it is capable of seeking out soft targets and administering any number of toxins and chemicals via its numerous hypodermic blades, allowing it to stealthily collect samples from an area, or infect select targets with manufactured pathogens and ailments, making it not only an excellent scout, but also a silent killer.

Essentially flying warriors, the Wasp is designed to perform rapid hit and run strikes against the enemy to support more powerful ground forces by striking from above and behind. They are limited in their weaponry to weapons without much recoil and cannot use conventional armor. What they lack in durability they more than make up for in speed, however, and a swarm of Wasps will rarely leave the enemy in good spirits. They can dive from above to perform a high damage melee strike, but are vulnerable while doing so.

Lightly armed and armored, this drone focuses entirely on closing in on enemy craft and quickly engaging. Its speed and maneuverability are phenomenal, but it has no proper armor, and only the most basic of weapons. The Light Interceptor is best used in conjunction with other drones, moving in quickly ahead of more heavy hitters to gather detailed data, measure the strength of the target, and soften enemy units with harassing attacks as the larger drones close in. They have no notable air-to-ground attack capabilities, and are focused entirely on an air superiority role, using their speed, size, and low upkeep cost as their main advantages. They are typically the bulk of any defensive air force, supporting other craft with their numbers and quick response time.

Essentially a large warrior, the Colossus is a lumbering weapons platform suitable for both long range support and front line assaults. The graft hard point on its back can be used to deploy a Thorn cannon for artillery, a Rotary Stinger for Anti-Air, or any other potential tasks, while the head mounted hard point can be used for all manner of close range weapons, such as a rotary for anti-personnel and suppression, or a Plasma Spray for area denial and clearing out enemy cover. It is capable of short bursts of surprising speed, but is otherwise incredibly slow. Its blades, while rarely used, are massive two meter retractable spikes more than capable of puncturing any armor it may come across, and its own armor is thick enough to shrug off all but the most relentless of assaults.

It is capable of carrying medium drones into and out of combat while supporting them from the air with its tremendous firepower at either long or close range. The sound of its screech from above the clouds is not only used to assist in echolocation, but shakes morale as well.

Ships

Shuttle
Cost: 50N 150M
Size: 30 Meters
A slow but powerful transport, the shuttle is the workhorse of your hive’s industrial base.  Its primary use is the transport of goods and drones to and from orbit, although its small size and relatively good maneuverability makes it a good choice for dropping drones into combat. It is unarmed, but well armored with thick layers of metal reinforcing designed to protect whatever valuables it may be carrying. It has no room for an FTL drive, but can quickly move across a star system and can be deployed from larger ships if needed.

While fragile and lacking in ranged combat, the stealth corvette avoids these issues through evasion and agility. It is capable of easily hiding for short periods of time, and if needed, can unleash an unrelenting stream of plasma on an unsuspecting target. Its mixture of high close range damage potential and effective stealth abilities make it an excellent tool for quickly destroying single, isolated targets before they can retaliate, although if caught in a stand up fight it would quickly find itself outmatched. It foregoes a spinal mounted weapon in favor of a consumption beam, which lets it serve as an effective scout, finding and sampling potential resource locations.

Effectively a glass cannon, this fast corvette is capable of dealing exceptional damage at almost any range. With its mix of railgun and linear particle beams for long range combat it can project a respectable amount of firepower over a great distance, its autocannons are nothing to scoff at either, and are capable both as a deterrent against small craft and as a fallback weapon against anything that may stray too close. Its greatest weapon is its shortest range option, with a full complement of plasma lances it is capable of unleashing hellfire upon any foe that gets within its grasp. Destruction is the singular purpose with little concern for survivability or damage resistance making the Lancer an excellent choice as a vanguard or first strike option in an attack, as well as a competent bombardment vessel.

A more drastic departure from the maneuverable and evasive ships of the past, this heavy corvette is designed purely for defensive use as a picket force. Slow, expensive, and unable to hide, this ship excels at blocking enemy forces and supporting its capital allies by destroying small targets and hampering large ones, but it is a poor choice for situations that would require speed or grace over brute firepower and durability.

Heavily armed and armored, this frigate is designed to operate with its similarly armored heavy fleet counterparts to target and destroy enemy invaders. Using the corvettes to its advantage, this frigate is able to hit weakened ships with heavy firepower while being able to take heavy punishment from attackers, however it is slow and ineffective at pursuing or patrolling, limiting its effective roles to picket defense or main combat situations.

This powerful warship is designed to use its stealth to end fights before they begin, but has the durability and firepower to take on whatever may survive its initial ambush. As its name implies, it is best suited as the first into combat, serving as the vanguard to a larger fleet by taking out strategic targets first before the rest of the hive fleet reveals itself.
